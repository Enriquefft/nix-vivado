1. First observe the CLI options of the installer with:

....
bash petalinux-v${version}.run --help
....

  - Use the `--dir` option to install all petalinux tools to a reasonable
    location, to which you also have write permissions. 
  - Use the `--platform` option to choose the platforms you need.
  - An option that is not documented in the `--help` text, is the
    `--skip_license` option, which speeds up the installation a bit.

2. Create or edit the file `~/.config/xilinx/nix.sh` and write to it the
   installation directory you chose with `--dir` (e.g):

....
PETALINUX=$HOME/downloads/software/xilinx/petalinux
....

3. Lastly, it has been observed that one of the shared objects installed cause
   issues with `petalinux-config`. To fix this, you may need to do something
   like this (assuming `$PETALINUX`):

....
mv "$PETALINUX"/tools/xsct/lib/lnx64.o/libedit.so.0{,.bak}
....
